# Playwright Test Reports to GitHub Pages

This repository publishes Playwright test reports to a GitHub Pages site after every CI/CD run. The reports are generated using Allure and deployed with the `actions-gh-pages` GitHub Action.

> âœ¨ If you're here because you're stuck trying to get Allure working with in GitHub Actions with GitHub Pages and subdirectories... Hopefully this saves you a few hours of your life.

#### What I Learned the Hard Way
- Allure history links break if the report isn't served from your main..
- ..username.github.io repo. The links will point to your homepage instead
- You can't easily override Allure's base path via the Marketplace Action
- BFG Repo-Cleaner is a lifesaver ðŸ›Ÿ when your repo grows to 1GB and will get even bigger
- Race condition if multiple pull requests opened around the same time (read more below)
- Sometimes it's just better to stick with the simpler tool (Playwright's HTML reporter)

## Setup

The setup is managed through the YAML file `playwright-mysite.yml`, located in the my main website repository. You can view the YAML configuration file directly [here](https://github.com/readytotest/readytotest.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/playwright-mysite.yml).

## How It Works

1. **Playwright Tests**: After running Playwright tests, Allure generates the test reports.
2. **Deployment**: The generated reports are automatically deployed to the GitHub Pages site using the `actions-gh-pages` GitHub Action.
3. **Automation**: This entire process is triggered by push or PR in the `readytotest.github.io` repo (my website)
4. **Live Reports**: The reports are deployed to the GitHub Pages site. You can view them here [readytotest.github.io/playwright-allure-report](https://readytotest.github.io/playwright-allure-report/).

## Where the Report Files Live

If you're wondering where the report files live in this repository, they are located in the `live-reports` branch. You can view them on the [live-reports branch](https://github.com/readytotest/playwright-allure-report/tree/live-reports).

> I saw in the [Allure docs](https://allurereport.org/docs/playwright/#writing-tests) that you can annotate Playwright tests with metadata. It's cool stuff, but I'm not adding any of that to my Playwright specs. I already burned ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ through 24 hours just ðŸ”Œ wiring âž°âš¡ this thing up to CI and GitHub Pages, and I'm not really looking to go deeper right now.

## Repo Size - Problem & Solution

The repository grew in size due to large files (`.webm` and `.png`) being tracked by Git, _even after deletion_. This led to the repository growing to 1GB. I created [The Repo Clean-O-Matic (YAML)](https://github.com/readytotest/playwright-allure-report/blob/main/.github/workflows/repo-clean-o-matic.yml) that runs the **BFG Repo-Cleaner** to **rewrite Git history** and remove these files from all commits, except the latest production commit. This process can be run manually via GitHub Actions and runs automatically every Sunday at 12:00 UTC.

## Race Conditions on Concurrent PRs

If multiple pull requests are open and their workflows try to access the the branch the Allure reports live in, you might hit a race condition when one of the workflows tries to push the report back to that repo. `! [remote rejected] live-reports -> live-reports (cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/live-reports': is locked`

In my case it's multiple Dependabot PRs all being opened at the same time that cause this, and it's not a big deal for me. I just merge whichever one passed clean, and the others sort themselves out by automatically rebasing and rerunning. I'm not looking into a fix because it doesn't disrupt anything for me.  Worst case, I hit 'rerun job' and it's fine. 

## Issue with History Links

Allure's history links use relative paths (like `#testresult/abcd123`). If you're hosting the report in a subdirectory (like `https://yourusername.github.io/playwright-allure-report/`), those links break and take you to the root of your main site instead of the test result.

You'd expect a 404, but that's not what happens. Since it's a hash (#), the browser doesn't treat it like a real path. It just sees it as a jump link (id), so it goes to the homepage of your main GitHub Pages site.

The URLs look like this:  
https://readytotest.github.io/#testresult/abcd123

But they should look like this:  
https://readytotest.github.io/playwright-allure-report/#testresult/abcd123

The issue is, even when I manually type what seems like the correct link, the report page loads, but I get an 'object not found' error in the middle of it. I think it's because the internal file paths inside the report are also broken, as if the app tries to load other files from the wrong place. That's my guess, anyway.

#### Why a Subdirectory?

I'm hosting the report in a subdirectory because my **main repo** (`readytotest.github.io`) is where my personal website lives. I had to put the report in a **different repo** and serve it from a subdirectory, which is why this issue happens.

### GitHub Marketplace Action Limitation

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any documentation on how to account for this issue in the GitHub Marketplace Action for Allure.

## My Thoughts

This whole investigation, setup, configuration, and troubleshooting with Allure was a big challenge. Well to be clear, the **local install** was fairly straightforward. Running it locally wasn't the problem. The real time sink was getting it into **CI/CD**, troubleshooting all the issues, and making sure everything worked smoothly. I'm not the type to throw my hands up when things get tricky. If something's broken or confusing, I want to figure out why and get it working.

After all that, I actually prefer the built-in **Playwright HTML reporter** ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜¹. It's way easier to set up and configure, with a lot fewer moving parts to break and maintain. 

I just went down this Allure rabbit hole out of curiosity and the challenge of it. Kind of like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle on your front room table. That's exactly how it felt. The Playwright HTML reporter just feels simpler and for most CI/CD setups, that's probably all you really need anyway. You can upload that HTML report as an artifact and attach it during the run to the GitHub Actions workflow summary page.
