# THIS SCRIPT WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP THE REPO SIZE SMALL THAT HOSTS THE ALLURE REPORTS
# OTHERWISE THE REPO SIZE WILL GROW WAY TOO BIG EVEN IF YOU DELETE THE FILES
# AT MY RATE IT WAS GROWING ABOUT 1GB EVERY TWO WEEKS, WHICH MEANS I'D HIT THE 5GB LIMIT QUICKLY
# BECAUSE GIT KEEPS THE HISTORY OF ALL FILES EVEN IF YOU DELETE THEM (AND THEY STILL COUNT TOWARDS THE SIZE)

# CAUTION: üö® This will rewrite the git history and remove .webm & .png files for good.
# WARNING: üíÄ Once executed, the files are permanently deleted from the git history.
# NOTICE!: üìå You need to go into the repo settings/actions/general/workflow permissions/enable set read+write
# EXTRA:   ‚ÑπÔ∏è The token used here is the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN. Not a personal access token (PAT). So you don't need to create a new token.
# EXTRA:   ‚ÑπÔ∏è At first, I tried git filter-repo, but had a bunch of issues to troubleshoot. So I used BFG Repo-Cleaner instead.
# EXTRA:   ‚ÑπÔ∏è I also tried the suggested way of cloning a mirror with git, but had issues later in the workflow.
# EXTRA:   ‚ÑπÔ∏è And that is why I ended up using the GitHub Marketplace Actions/Checkout with fetch-depth: 0.
# EXTRA:   ‚ÑπÔ∏è I think I got this all dialed in the way I want it now. Time will tell. lol

      # GitHub typically takes a while to update the repo.size, which can significantly delay testing changes to the script. 
      # This creates a challenge during QA testing, as it's hard to tell if any issues are due to the changes you made or simply
      # because the repo size hasn't updated yet. 
      # It becomes even trickier when multiple changes are made, as it‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint which one actually caused the size change! 
      # If you're tweaking the script, it's best to wait at least a full day before checking the size to avoid confusion.
      # Hopefully this will help you avoid the headache of trying to figure out if the script is working or if it's just GitHub being slow to update. LOL
      
      # To avoid waiting for the repo.size update, you can clone a fresh local copy of the repository and check the history directly.
      # After cloning the repo, run the following commands to see what .webm or .png files are still present in the history:
      # https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-list
      # For .webm files:
      # git rev-list --objects --all | grep '\.webm$'
      #
      # For .png files:
      # git rev-list --objects --all | grep '\.png$'
      #
      # Or both together:
      # git rev-list --objects --all | grep -E '\.png$|\.webm$'

      # One last way you can check the size of the repo and not have to wait around for the GitHub repo.size to update
      # After you run the cleaner, just clone a new copy of the repo and run the following command: du -sh .git
      # Or just go navigate to the repo in your file explorer and right click it and get info on macOS
